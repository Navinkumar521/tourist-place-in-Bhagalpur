<h><b>1.&nbsp;Rabindra Bhawan</b></h><hr/>
<img src="Rabindra Bhawan.jpg" align="center" height="400" width="100%">
<p>Rabindra Bhavan was built to mark the birth centenary of Tagore, who in addition to being a poet and novelist, was an artist, playwright and composer. The building is thus the home of three National Academies: Lalit Kala (Plastic Arts), Sangeet Natak (Dance, Drama and Music) and Sahitya (Literature).</p>
<p>Rabindra Bhawan has a chequered history. It is located at Sitanabad only 4.7km away from Bhagalpur and is among the major tourist attractions of the place. This monument was known as Tilha Kothi and is also among the various buildings associated with Bhagalpur University. Situated on top of a mound, this building is truly beautiful. The building is associated with important personalities that include Cleveland, Hastings and Raja Chet Singh of Oudh. But, the main personality after whom the building is named is of course Rabindranath Tagore, who visited this place and stayed here in 1910. It is understood that the poet laureate penned a few verses of Geetanjali while residing in Tilha Kothi. Entry is free. The place is closed on Sundays.

<img src="Maharshi Mehi Ashram.jpg" align="center" height="400" width="100%">
<p>Maharshi Mehi Ashram is situated along the river side. Kuppaghat, Bhagalpur has grown into a sacred spiritual spot for thousands as Saint Maharishi spent many years in intense meditation on the inner light and sound at Bhagalpur/attractions/kuppaghat/" title="Kuppaghat">Kuppaghat along the banks of the Ganges near Bhagalpur in the state of Bihar. The followers of Maharshi Meh celebrate the occasion of Guru Purnima with great zest and vigour.</p>
<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Kuppaghat is a place located by the banks of the holy river Ganges in Bhagalpur, Bihar. Kuppaghat translates to “cave by the banks of a river” and accordingly has a cave which is believed to have been used by Maharshi Mehi Paramhans as a place for meditation. Kuppaghat has been transformed in the later years as Maharshi Mehi Ashram and has grown to be a pilgrimage for the Followers of Santmat. Every year on the occasion of the Birth Anniversary of Maharshi Mehi, Maharshi Santsevi who was Mehi’s successor and on Guru Purnima, the Ashram is visited by many devotees. This dearness of the devotees made the Ashram as the National Headquarters of Akhila Bharatiya Santmat-Satsang. The Kuppaghat Ashram has a well-maintained garden and Orchard with sculptures and paintings of scenes depicting Lord Rama’s visit to Shabari and also of Jatayu’s death in the hands of Ravana along with spiritual quotes.</p><p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Maharshi Mehi Paramhans, also known as Gurumaharaj, studied the Vedas and the Upanishad besides the Bhagavad Gita as well as the Holy Bible and was a saint in the Sant Mat tradition. He was also well versed in Buddhism and the Quran. He propagated the easiest method to achieve Moksha with the help of Satsang and Meditation or Dhyan. One of the direct disciples of Baba Devi Sahab of Muradabad, UP, he was the main guru in Akhil Bhartiya Santmat Satsang. Born in Majhua, a small village in Bihar, on 28 April 1885, Maharshi Mehi was an intense worshipper of Lord Shiva. The sage left household life when he was still studying Class X.

<img src="mandharhill.jpg" align="center" height="400" width="100%">
<p>

Mandar Parvat, also known as Mandar Hill is a small mountain situated in Banka district under Bhagalpur division of state of Bihar.[1] It is about 700 ft high and approximately 45 km south of Bhagalpur city off Bausi, a place located on the state highway between Bhagalpur and Dumka. Mandar Hill is a great place of pilgrimage although it is not so well known now. On top of the hill are a Hindu and a Jain temple.[2]<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
The mountain has many references in hindu mythology known as mandarachal parvat. As per references found from Puranas and Mahabharata this hill was used for churning the ocean to extract the nectar from its bosom (Samudra Manthan). 
There is, adjacent to this hill, a pond called "Paapharni". This holy pond has its own historical significance. It is a place where you can revive yourself after taking a bath in the pond that refreshes mentally and physically. In the middle of the pond is a temple of lord Vishnu and goddess Laxmi. </p><p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Many rare sculptures of Lord Shiva, Kamdhenu and Varaah, believed to be of 11-12th century AD, can be found to be scattered around Mandar Hill. These rare artifacts need to be conserved by Archaeological Survey of India. [3]</p>

<h><b>5.&nbsp;Vikramsila University</b></h><hr/>
<img src="vikramsila university.jpg" align="center" height="400" width="100%">
<p>Vikramshila University was one of the two most important Buddhist learning centres in ancient India during the Pala dynasty. It had an equal footing along with Nalanda University in the domain of Buddhist learning.</p><p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Vikramshila was established by King Dharmapala when he felt a decline in the quality of learning at Nalanda. The ruins of the ancient university are a sight of marvel as it is a huge square monastery with a stupa in the centre, a library building and a cluster of stupas. A Tibetan and a Hindu temple have also been excavated.</p>
<ul>
<li>HISTORY</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of monasteries grew up during the Pāla period in ancient Bengal and Magadha. According to Tibetan sources, five great Mahaviharas stood out: Vikramashila, the premier university of the era; Nalanda, past its prime but still illustrious, Somapura, Odantapura, and Jagaddala.[2] The five monasteries formed a network; "all of them were under state supervision" and there existed "a system of co-ordination among them. It seems from the evidence that the different seats of Buddhist learning that functioned in eastern India under the Pāla were regarded together as forming a network, an interlinked group of institutions," and it was common for great scholars to move easily from position to position among them.</p><p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Vikramashila was founded by Pāla king Dharmapala in the late 8th or early 9th century. It prospered for about four centuries before it was destroyed by Bakhtiyar Khilji along with the other major centres of Buddhism in India around 1193.[4][5] 
Vikramashila is known to us mainly through Tibetan sources, especially the writings of Tāranātha, the Tibetan monk historian of the 16th–17th centuries.[6]</p><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Vikramashila was one of the largest Buddhist universities, with more than one hundred teachers and about one thousand students. It produced eminent scholars who were often invited by foreign countries to spread Buddhist learning, culture and religion. The most distinguished and eminent among all was Atisha Dipankara, a founder of the Sarma traditions of Tibetan Buddhism. Subjects like philosophy, grammar, metaphysics, Indian logic etc. were taught here, but the most important branch of learning was Buddhist tantra.[7]</p>

<h><b>6.&nbsp;Vikramshila Setu</b></h><hr/>
<img src="Vikramshila Setu.jpg" align="center" height="400" width="100%">
<p>Vikramshila Setu is a bridge across the Ganges, near Bhagalpur in the Indian state of Bihar named after the ancient Mahavihara of Vikramashila which was established by King Dharmapala (783 to 820 A.D.) . 
Vikramshila Setu is 5th longest bridge over water in India. The 4.7 km long two lane bridge serves as a link between NH 33 and NH 31 running on the opposite sides of the Ganges. It runs from Barari Ghat on the Bhagalpur side on the south bank of the Ganges to Naugachia on the north bank.[1] It also connects Bhagalpur to Purnia and Katihar. This has reduced considerably the road travel between Bhagalpur and places across the Ganges. </p><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp However, there is intense traffic congestion on the bridge due to increased traffic and there is now a demand to construct another bridge parallel to it. On 21 September 2020 Prime Minister Mr Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of another 4 lane road bridge of 4.445 km length over Ganga river parallel to Vikramshila Setu at cost of Rs. 1110.23 crore.[2] In June 2018, another 24 km-long Vikramshila - Kataria rail-cum-road bridge between Vikramshila railway station (near Pirpainty south of Ganga) and Kataria railway station (near Naugachia railway station) north of the Ganga, with an expenditure of Rs 4,379.01 crore was approved.[3]</p>

<h><b>7.&nbsp;Ajgaibinath Temple</b></h><hr/>
<img src="Ajgaibinath Temple.jpg" align="center" height="400" width="100%">
<p> Ajgaivinath Temple of Lord Shiva is located in Sultanganj, a town in Bhagalpur district of Bihar in India. Also known as Gaibinath Mahadeo, this is one of the rare ancient Hindu temples where the deity Lord Siva has existed as ‘Swayambhu’. Ajgaivinath Shiva Temple has been constructed on a rock which is projected out from the holy river Ganges. To reach here, there are boat services from Murli Hills of Sultanganj.</p><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The origin of the temple is shrouded in mystery. According to the legend lord Shiva took a bow known as Ajgav and so the place came to be known as Ajgaivinath. It is commonly said that Kalapahar failed to demolish Ajgaivinath temple, but he could destroy the Parvati temple on the neighbouring hill and built a mosque there. Formerly, this hill must have been bigger and spacious. The high floods and the constant strong currents of the Ganga must have worn away the decaying granite rocks of the hill. The present village Jahangira to the west of Sultangang still keeps alive the memory of the Ashram of Jahnu Muni. The name of Jahangira appears to be the distorted form of Jahnugiri (the hill of Jahnu) or Jahnu griha (the abode of Jahnu).
During the rule of the Mauryas, Guptas and Palas many works of art and architecture were raised at Sultanganj. The area has yielded ancient relics like stupas, seals, coins, terracotta and Hindu and Buddha images. Many carvings can still be seen in the Sultanganj hills. A number of small images along with a copper image of Lord Buddha about seven feet high were excavated here. A Buddha image found in Sultanganj is now in Birmingham Museum.
A large number of antiquities covered from krishnagarh at Sultanganj have been preserved in Patna Museum. They indicate a very high standard of Hindu religiosity and culture. The fact that some of the images and other antiquities are Buddhistic reiterates that the area was very important from Buddhistic point of view as well. Most of the antiquities have been identified with the medieval period.
Through various vicissitudes, Sultanganj continued in importance in the later centuries. It is peculiar that a place which has the famous Shiva temple known as Ajgaivinath, which is quite old, should have a name which has a clear Muslim impress. It is all the more so when it is remembered that Ajgaivinath temple is one of the three famous Shiva temples in Bihar & Jharkhand, the two other being Basukinath and Baidyanath temples.</p><br>
