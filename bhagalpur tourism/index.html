<p>The old Bhagalpur region is believed to have contemporaneous to Patliputra or present day Patna, the capital of Bihar. Mandara Parvat located in Bhagalpur finds mention in many Hindu religious texts. Kalidasa's work Kumarasambhava refers to foot prints of Lord Vishnu on the gradients of Mandara at present day Bhagalpur district. The present day’s Bhagalpur was a city which was profoundly accepted as one of the major trade centers of Eastern Indian region right from 7th century. An evidence for this information has been found in the ancient writings of Chinese scholars and voyagers Hsüan-tsang and Fa-Hien. That ancient Bhagalpur city had a huge harbor on the Ganga riverside at a location known as Champanagar in earlier times and at present known as Champanala. Throughout an archaeological excavation program, several antique boat pieces and ancient coins have been found in current day’s Bhagalpur district and they belong to the Middle and the Far East. Prehistoric cave sculptures during the reign of monarch Ashoka from 274 to 232 BC are found in the zone and at Sultangunj, which is 20 km west of Bhagalpur district, a temple from the Gupta epoch still survives in Bhagalpur. The remains of antique Vikramshila University are situated 44 km east of Bhagalpur. The imperial university lines next to Nalanda, and owes its derivation to Dharmapala, the pious Pala king who declared himself Paramasaugata (principal worshipper of the Buddha) and was a huge patron of Mahayana Buddhism.<p>

<p>Within the city we can visit Karnagarh and the four hillocks, attractive Jain Temple,a Christ Church near the city tower and an old Symmetry in very ruined shape. Bhagalpur museum beside Burh Nath temple on the riverside in Jogasar Mohakka. Bhagalpur is equally famous for Visharhi Asthan, the venue for the Bihula or the Mansa Puja held every july when the snakes are worshipped. A little distance from the Visharhi Asthan temple lies the colourful Durga Asthan. Next door is the Mahashay Deori-a typical thakur Bari. Mahashay was the honorific hereditary title given by Akabar in 1664 to Sri Mughal Zamindar's residence of deori replete with open court yard, a temple with a strange deity called Batuk Bhairab9Possiblly a Buddhist image) which was discovere by the early Mahashays at Tilhakothi where they used to live during the Mughal Days.</font></p>
